I am Lydia Gandy-Fastovich and I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Utah. My research interests include bridging research fields together for a more interdisciplinary perspective of educational equity. Primarily foccused on policy analysis, parents, and leaders in education, my research agenda investigates the various stakeholders and components necessary to reach combat the various marginalizations (e.g., race, gender identity, dis/ability status, etc.) occuring in our society, and consequently, our schools. 

In my postdoctoral studies, I work alongside Drs. Laura Rogers and David Woo to investigate principal pipelines, leadership identity and educator well-being. My previous scholarship interrogates parent-school partnerships for parents of children receiving special education. Additionally, I have worked collaboratively with other scholars in policy analysis and looked at the ways in which educational leaders make sense of policy protections for students.
